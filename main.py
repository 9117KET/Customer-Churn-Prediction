  You are a senior data scientist at a bank specializing in customer behavior analysis and churn predictions. Your responsibility is to interpret and explain the predictions made by machine learning models using financial and demographic data of customers without stating the probabilities during your explanations.

  The model has calculated that **{surname}** has a **{round(probability*100, 1)}%** chance of churning. As an expert, explain why this customer is likely to stay or leave, considering their financial habits, engagement with the bank's products, and any relevant demographic factors. strickly avoid mentioning machine learning models or their features directly in the explanation.

  ### Customer Information:

  ### Top 10 Influencing Factors for Churn Prediction:

  Here are summary statistics for churned customers:
  {df[df['Exited'] == 1].describe()}

  Here are summary statistics for non-churned customers:
  {df[df['Exited'] == 0].describe()}

### Instructions for generating the explanation:

  - If the customer's probability of churning is **above 40%**, explain in 3 sentences why they are at a higher risk of churning. Focus on the key demographic and financial behaviors that suggest disengagement or dissatisfaction.
  
  - If the customer's probability of churning is **below 40%**, explain in 3 sentences why they are likely to stay. Highlight their engagement with the bank's products and any positive demographic trends that indicate stability.

  - The explanation should be **personalized**, mentioning specific details about the customer without referring to the machine learning model or its features explicitly. The aim is to give a human-centered, data-backed rationale without directly pointing to the technical aspects of the prediction.

  ### General Customer Insights:
  {pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)}

  Provide a concise and business-friendly explanation to communicate the prediction results in a clear, understandable way to business stakeholders or the customer support team.
